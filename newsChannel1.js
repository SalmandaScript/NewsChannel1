Among his various nicknames, he is referred to as Worl Boss or Teacha. As summarized by Rolling Stone, he attained folk-hero status in Jamaica with provocative lyrics, and a mischievous public persona, and few have captivated the dancehall audience – or offended the sensibilities of its detractors  as consistently and thoroughly as Kartel. Kartel`s singles include Romping Shop 2009, Dancehall Hero 2010, and Summer Time 2011. Having collaborated with a number of hip hop and R&B artists such as Major Lazer, Rihanna, Jay Zee, Digga D, Missy Elliot, Unknown T and Alison Hinds. He has also been credited as an inspiration for the dancehall-infused work of a number of Western artists, including Drake, who has cited Kartel as being one of his biggest inspirations. In 2014, Kartel was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his associate Clive Lizard Williams. The conviction was quashed on March 14, 2024 by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, who cited juror misconduct and declared that the Jamaican Court of Appeal had to decide if a retrial would take place, the decision of which will take place starting on June 10. Kartel often released new music despite his imprisonment, having released over 50 new songs in 2016 alone. His hit song Fever was certified gold in June 2020.");
